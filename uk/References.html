                        <h3>Story:</h3>
                        <p>At the center of the ring is the logo of the brand from the client himself in 3D surrounded by london blue stones which gives the logo more shine and a more dominant look. The stones where chosen specifically in that color to bring the story of the whole brand itself to the foreground. All together was made to look like the logo is swimming on the ocean. </p>

                        <p>Great attention and care was given to the logo itself to make it appear as authentic as possible. The stones with there colors where arranged in a way to highlight the logo even more in a way that it is coming more to the foreground. The letters; GET, where used as the holder for the later chain from the piece itself, the chain goes behind the letters to bring the piece even more to the foreground.</p>
